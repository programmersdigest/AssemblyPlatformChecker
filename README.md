[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/programmersdigest/AssemblyPlatformChecker?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/programmersdigest/AssemblyPlatformChecker?branch=master&svg=true)
# AssemblyPlatformChecker
Checks assemblies for platform compatibility (x86, x64, AnyCPU).

# Usage
AssemblyPlatformChecker.exe [-v] <searchPath>
  
| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| searchPath | The path to search for portable executable (PE) files. If the path points to a file, this file is checked. If the path points to a directory, all executables contained in this directory and al its sub directories are checked. In case a relative path is supplied, it is considered relative to the AssemblyPlatformChecker executable. The path may be ommited, in which case the directory containing the AssemblyPlatformChecker executable is searched. |
| -v | Activates verbose output which prints more information on each assembly. |
| -f: | Filters the output by platform. Platforms to be displayed can be provided as a comma separated list. Valid platforms are: Native32, Native64, Dotnet32, Dotnet64, AnyCPU, AnyCPU32Preferred, Unknown. |
| -h | Prints this help. |
